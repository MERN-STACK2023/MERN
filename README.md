# MERN Stack
- a JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications
- the four key technologies that make up the layers of the stack are
  - M: MongoDB
  - E: Express
  - R: React
  - N: Nodejs

______________________________
## M: MongoDB
- Performance: the speed at which a collection is queried is very fast without 
- Flexibility: very easy to make structural changes without wreaking havac, it like adding a new property to a object
- Scalability: can support large databases with high request rates at a very low latency
- Usability: can get up and running in the cloud very fast
 - stores data in collections
    - collections holds all the data about an object(Example object would be a user)
    - this data is not broken into related tables like in SQL or relational DBs
    - duplicating and distributing the data where deemed mecessary in a no sql structure is allowed
 - individual records are called documents
    - documents have a key/value structure and look like json
